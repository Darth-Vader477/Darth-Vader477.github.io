          Climate change is a term used to describe a change in global or regional climate patterns that are created from the release of carbon emissions. Climate change has been a topic of debate over the past century, due to the fact that people simply cannot agree on the facts. Some people believe that climate change is a fad created by governments to increase profits from taxes and that the global temperature is normalizing. On the other hand, most scientists are certain that climate change is no joke. In this argument, my goal is to prove the disbelievers wrong. I believe that humans are the main cause of climate change and that it is not a natural cycle.

          Many people are certain that climate change is not an issue and that the recent drop in winter temperatures is proof of that. They often use an argument similar to the following: the United States recently underwent an extreme deep freeze, breaking a ridiculous number of records, with some places reaching below -50 degrees Fahrenheit (-45 Celcius). Many people believe this event is evidence that the planet is actually getting colder, not warmer. The average temperature for Minnesota in January is 16 degrees Fahrenheit (-8 degrees Celsius), meaning the temperature dropped close to 70 degrees Fahrenheit (28 Celsius) below average. This recent deep freeze may support the argument that climate change actually causes extreme temperatures and not just global warming. Some experts suggest that the overall rise in temperatures could be helping the earth more than harming it.

            Could Greenhouse Gasses be Helping More then Hurting?
          </h4>
          <p>
            It is now believed that the rise in carbon emissions is helping to support plant life. Due to the huge rise in carbon emissions, plants have been using 30% percent more carbon dioxide, greatly increasing plant growth. Up until recently, scientists were unable to accurately track the number of carbon emissions released into the atmosphere due to the fact that carbon dioxide disappears when it is absorbed by plants. A trace gas known as carbonyl sulfide was recently discovered that can be tracked and estimated.  This breakthrough will allow scientists to more accurately track and estimate carbon emissions. If scientists become more capable of accurately calculating the release of carbon emissions, it would reduce the risk of overestimation and would be able to prove the climate change issue once and for all. Speaking of debunking, some people are certain that we are merely undergoing a warmer time period which happens in cycles in Earth’s history.

            Changing Temperature Periods?
          </h4>
          <p>
            There have been extreme variations of temperatures throughout the many time periods of the Earth. From ice ages to extreme warm periods, the Earth has experienced its fair share of extreme climates. Perhaps the Earth is simply going through a more intense climate period and humans have no part in it. Humanity has rapidly increased plant growth and is helping the environment through the rise of carbon emissions. This argument is commonly used by climate change skeptics as their main argument. However, there is far more evidence confirming climate change than excuses for the massive increase in carbon emissions.

            Greenhouse Emissions
          </h4>
          <p>
            Humanity is almost entirely responsible for the massive increase in greenhouse gases emissions in recent years and has drastically sped up the process of climate change. A huge amount of technology created in the past 150 years creates greenhouse gasses, take cars for example. These extremely useful pieces of machinery can be found everywhere and are the most commonly found source of carbon emissions. In 2015, transportation based carbon emissions made up 24% of the carbon emissions of the year. Automobiles may be the most commonly found source of greenhouse gasses but they are not the most abundant. Oil sands production and natural gas burning are the most abundant source making up 28% of the greenhouse emissions in Canada, with Canada creating a total of 722 megatons of greenhouse gases per year. To put that absolutely absurd number into perspective, 722 megatons is equal to 722,000,000,000 kilograms or around 120,000,000 full grown elephants. That outrageous amount of greenhouse gases was only the emissions of Canada, with only 0.5% of the global population. Compared to emissions globally, Canada is considered to be one of the more eco-friendly countries when it comes to carbon emissions. This high concentration of greenhouse gasses has created a thickening layer of gases surrounding the planet.

            The Greenhouse Effect
            </h4>
            <p>
            Known as the greenhouse “blanket” or the greenhouse effect, the layer formed around our planet was formerly the layer that protects us from the cold vacuum of space.  It is now creating a multitude of problems. The layer is now preventing heat from escaping the planet and is also preventing temperatures from normalizing. Greenhouse gases prevent heat for escaping due to the fact that greenhouse gas molecules are far more complex than other molecules within the atmosphere and the chemical structure was designed to absorb harsh temperatures. The layer is the reason why we can even breathe on earth so trying to remove the layer is not an option.

              Artic destruction
              </h4>
              <p>
              Humanity is single-handedly responsible for the destruction of the Arctic. The greenhouse blanket  is not just causing Arctic ice to melt, it is causing the polar vortex to shift and move around.  The recent deep freeze that happened in the United States was caused due to the polar vortex shifting south for an extended period.  The polar air was unable to escape into the atmosphere due to the greenhouse effect and headed south into the United States. Weather events like this could cause more and more frequent fluctuation of temperatures. There are a large number of popular organizations, such as Greenpeace and Climate Action Network, that are devoted to confirming the existence of climate change.

        <h4>
        Conclusion
        </h4>
        <p>
          In summary, climate change is definitely caused by humanity and is not a part of the natural climate cycles of our planet. Climate change is no laughing matter and is responsible for the massive fluctuations in temperatures recently. The immature ideas that some people get within their head regarding climate change are weak and provide little evidence. The fact that some people are naive enough to believe that climate change is helping the planet is not solving the problem. The Earth simply cannot handle the ridiculous amount of carbon emissions produced by mankind and cannot continue to properly support life due to the greenhouse layer blanketing our planet. Humanity has single-handedly doomed our Earth.
